This document was worked on during the 10th Annual NYUAD Hackathon as a Quantum Computing Solution for Social Good.
This is a solution for the assignment of different patients to different hospitals. The decision takes into consideration many criteria such as the distance between the location of the patient to each hospital and the availability of the hospital in terms of number of available beds and the severity of the patient's case.

The values in the list of equipment E can be calculated based on the following levels medical need and severity:
- Primary care hospital:
    - Basic Live support (BLS)
    - Basic Live support (BLS) emergency
- Secondary referral hospital
    - Advanced life support (ALS) level one 
    - Advanced life support (ALS) level one emergency 
    - Advanced life support (ALS) level two
- Tertiary referral hospital
    - Specialty care transport 
    - Paramedic Intercept
The different levels have to be normalized and added to the list of alpha values.
